// There are n cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile target.
// You are given two integer arrays position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the starting mile of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car in miles per hour.
// A car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.
// A car fleet is a single car or a group of cars driving next to each other. The speed of the car fleet is the minimum speed of any car in the fleet.
// If a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile target, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.
// Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
 

// Example 1:
// Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at target.
// The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
// The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.

// Example 2:
// Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
// Output: 1
// Explanation:
// There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.

// Example 3:
// Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
// Output: 1
// Explanation:
// The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The car starting at 4 (speed 1) travels to 5.
// Then, the fleet at 4 (speed 2) and the car at position 5 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
